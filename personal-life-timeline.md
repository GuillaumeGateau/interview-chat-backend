# A Semi-Complete Life Story

I was born in 1988, and from what I’ve been told, I nearly didn’t make it. There was a C-section, a cord around my neck (twice!), and endless crying whenever I had milk. It was all a bit dramatic. In those early months, I lived in a tiny spot called Ponce de Leon while our house was being built. I had a swing I loved more than anything, and apparently I took a beach vacation at just eight weeks old. I have “incriminating” photos of me sleeping on the sand. Good times.

### 1989
We moved to Decatur, GA, where I made my newspaper debut for some reason I can’t even remember. I was that kid who tried to crawl off the front porch, fell, and ended up turning blue. That earned me an ambulance ride and a one-day hospital stay. At the time, I had a caretaker who used to carry me around 24/7, spoiling me silly. (I was told I always had super rosy cheeks.)

### 1990
We relocated to the UK, first settling on Maze Hill before moving over to Blackheath. My ears gave me trouble, so I got my first set of tubes. I was apparently the kid always going, “What?” The neighborhood had a big old wall covered in ivy that I was brave enough (or silly enough) to climb. We also had a goldfish pond and, occasionally, a wandering pet that the local postman would return to us—still not sure who got the bigger laugh out of that.  
A relative had some work in Brussels for half a year, so that changed things up a bit. I remember also visiting Disney Paris with someone who helped take care of me. And there was a pizza place across the street in Blackheath that had these awesome garlic rolls.

There’s also a weird memory of a construction worker who supposedly cut off his thumb. I have no idea who told me that story, but yikes. We’d also visit this big indoor swimming place—still can’t recall the name, but I remember the echo of splashing water.

### 1992
I was at a school in England called the American School. I still have a small bean bag shaped like a heart from those days. I was also obsessed with a TV game show called *The Crystal Maze*, where contestants had to escape rooms. I used to pretend I was part of that.

### 1993
Tragedy struck when the caretaker from my early childhood passed away in a car crash around Christmas. It was devastating news, even if my memories were hazy from being so young.

### 1995
We moved back to the United States. I went to Oak Grove for school and then lived on a street near a golf course. I played baseball around that time and made some neighborhood friends who were also on a team.

### 1996
There was a big family shake-up. I ended up going to a different school called Kittredge, and my best friend there was someone who made life pretty fun. But soon after, we moved again.

### 1997
I landed in Marietta. Met a friend who introduced me to all sorts of shenanigans. I was in that typical 90s suburban world where you could bike around and explore until dinner time.

### 1998–1999
These years were kind of a blur—lots of adjusting, lots of everyday adventures.  

### 2000
The household dynamic shifted again; engagement, new beginnings, all of it happened so quickly. It felt like life was on fast-forward.

### 2001
I moved to Edwardsville, Illinois. We had a home near a country club, and I was finishing up middle school. Then 9/11 happened, which rattled everyone. That year was a big blur of traveling back and forth to see people I cared about.

### 2002
I started 9th grade. Ended up mowing lawns with a friend to make money—enough to buy myself a sweet stereo system, a decent TV, and a bunch of DVDs. I even bought a riding lawn mower, which remains one of my proudest early purchases. I was also hitting the gym like crazy and lost a bunch of weight. I had a personal trainer who later lost his life in Iraq, which hit me pretty hard.

### 2003
Moved back to Marietta. I got my learner’s permit and literally drove home in a big SUV. My schedule was all over the place, thinking we might move to Pickens, so I ended up commuting. That was the year of near-misses with deer on the road.

### 2004
I turned 16, got my license in Blue Ridge (even though I definitely rolled through a stop sign), and got my first real car—a 1991 burgundy Camaro. I felt on top of the world. Eventually, the move to Pickens happened.

### 2005
Moved back to Marietta again. Left home fairly early and bought my first car on my own. I decided to finish high school as fast as possible and got out earlier than most.  

### 2006
I worked on some construction projects that summer. I got nudged into a dorm situation at a local university, but then got convinced to go to KSU for proximity to old friends. That was the year I started taking more life decisions into my own hands.

### 2007
I did some summer school for calculus. Eventually, I got admitted to Georgia Tech. I was dedicated and dropped about 70 pounds, running 10 miles a day like a person possessed.

### 2008
Studied abroad in France—an absolute life-changer. It shaped my view of the world and introduced me to people from all over. I also realized I might lean more social-democrat in my thinking. Travel does that to you, I guess.

### 2009
Back at Tech, I decided to apply for a master’s program. Ended up scoring a full ride, which was incredible. It was a busy year of planning the next phase.

### 2010
Graduated from Tech and moved to Paris for a bit. I worked on farms, lived in Berlin for a while, and tried to sort out living situations with friends from abroad, which…didn’t exactly go smoothly. I eventually found a place in a big international residence in Paris and started a master’s program.

### 2011
Interned at a small dating startup (ironically enough) in Paris while finishing courses. That gave me some real-life work experience.

### 2012
I worked for a router company to pay the bills while studying. Then I finished school and got hired by a large tech firm in the south of France. On the side, I started a little project with a friend—my first shot at being a co-founder. Adopted a pet, too. Life was hectic and exciting.

### 2013
Got a job in Paris again, so I moved back. Then decided to switch continents and ended up in New York toward the end of the year.

### 2014
Landed a new job pretty quickly. Meanwhile, the side project I co-founded won a decent-sized contract. My co-founder also joined me in NYC. Busy year—lots of hustle, late nights, and NYC energy.

### 2015
The startup venture fizzled out. I decided to move to Seattle for work. Lived in Belltown, which felt so fresh and different. I definitely indulged too much in food and drinks, so my waistline started noticing…

### 2016
I adopted another pet in early spring. Then I basically got fired, which sent me packing to Austin. I lived downtown, near a busy street full of bars—super fun, maybe too fun. I moved up to the Domain area closer to work, but the weight gain continued. Champagne and good food will do that.
