# Remote Job Onboarding Guide

## Understanding the Organization
- Get a sense of how your organization looks and operates. Even if remote work is the norm now, that might eventually change.

## Clear Role Expectations
- Onboarding employees with a clear picture of their duties is key to successful hires.
- Ensure both you and the remote worker understand company values, team objectives, and individual goals.
- Establish time frames for training, reviews, and milestones to provide structure.

## Assigning Mentors or Buddies
- Assign a mentor or a peer "orientation buddy" to answer questions and support learning.
- This relationship fosters growth and creates a sense of connection.

## Building Connections Through Collaboration
- Remote employees value concrete goals and one-on-one time with their managers.
- Group activities, like case studies or team projects during onboarding, help forge bonds and introduce team members. These activities also provide opportunities for cross-training.

## Sharing Company Culture
- Send new employees links to articles, videos, and resources about company culture.
- Provide swag and ensure any hardware arrives early to facilitate a smooth orientation.

## Tailored Onboarding Plans
- Onboarding extends beyond orientation and is tailored for specific roles.
- While orientation introduces the organization, onboarding can last months and is focused on role-specific integration and development.

## Creating Emotional Connections
- Remote work can make new employees feel isolated. Create structures for informal moments to foster connection.
- These "little things" are crucial for building a strong culture.

## 30-60-90 Day Plans
- Develop a clear 30, 60, and 90-day plan for the new hire to align on role expectations.
- Include exercises that require cross-team collaboration or knowledge discovery to familiarize them with the team, company processes, and culture.

## Setting Up Remote Office Essentials
- Ensure the employee has all necessary remote office supplies, including hardware, software, good lighting, and a comfortable chair.

## Scheduling Key Meetings
- Schedule meetings with colleagues and team members during the first week.
- Focus on learning their roles, understanding company priorities, and identifying how they can support your success.
- Introduce yourself and ask for first-day tips. Their experience will be valuable.

## Communication and Gratitude
- Discuss communication preferences and task management needs on the first day.
- Be proactive in asking questions and express gratitude to those who provide help.
- Pay attention to communication norms, such as response times and preferred channels.

## Learning Tools and Processes

- Use available internal documentation to learn about company practices, customer research, and team goals.
- Browse chat histories or wikis for relevant insights.

## Building Rapport

- Follow up with colleagues for virtual coffee chats to learn about their roles and share your work.
- Engage with chatty coworkers to build connections through shared experiences.

## Effective Documentation Use
- Leverage internal documentation to understand company operations and goals.
- If documentation is incomplete, proactively ask colleagues for clarification.

## Cross-Functional Integration
- Proactively schedule meetings with cross-functional teammates to understand overlaps in work and foster collaboration.

## Managing Questions
- Prepare a list of questions and problems encountered during the day for scheduled meetings to avoid constant interruptions.
- Set aside time daily to discuss and resolve issues.

## Non-Verbal Communication Tips
- Smile, adjust your camera to maintain eye level, and use open body language to appear approachable and credible in virtual meetings.

## Maintaining Productivity
- Allow yourself time to adjust and learn. Techniques like power naps, meditation, and journaling can enhance productivity.

## Onboarding Preparation
- Begin onboarding as soon as the role is accepted. Set up systems, provide resources, and schedule video meetings for the first day.
- Ensure a personalized onboarding plan is ready to guide the new hireâ€™s journey.

## Final Notes
