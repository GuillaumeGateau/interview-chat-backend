# General Behavioral Questions

## Coming to the Office

"I'm a really social person and enjoy face-to-face interaction. I feel like the kind of bond and trust you build in person is on a much deeper level. Trust empowers teams to communicate more directly, attack the problem and not each other, and overall move faster. Additionally, allowing micro-moments for connecting in person has been one of the most difficult parts of WFH.

Another benefit is that it creates a clear separation between your personal and professional life. This is good for your mental health and your career. For work, it eliminates a lot of small distractions. Our best work often comes when we're "in the zone." Little distractions can unintentionally take you out of that. While each distraction seems small and innocent, they aggregate on something like video into a larger problem and decrease professionalism and attention.

In-person communication builds more trust which allows you to focus on the problem. It reduces miscommunication while improving collaboration in a focused environment."

## Fast-Paced Environment

"My brain works a million miles a minute. I have a penchant for diving deep into decisions, applying logical thought, and then moving forward swiftly. It's not about feeding my brain the right stimuli, but rather the sheer love for the energy and momentum that a team displays as they aggressively pursue their goals.

In fast-paced environments, the emphasis is on being as objective as possible. Such settings compel individuals to lean heavily on their core values, especially when faced with dilemmas. Clarity in the decision-making process aids tremendously. At times, it's essential to disagree and commit, especially since there are always new problems awaiting solutions.

What's paramount to understand is the rapid pace at which the world changes, with sectors like social media leading the charge. If a team is slow to adapt or finds itself mired in over-analysis, there's a real risk of being left behind. It's not our ambition to merely emulate others â€“ we aim to be pioneers in our domain.

Reflecting on this, it becomes evident why we place such importance on all the topics we discussed on working together."

## Prioritization in Fast-Paced Environments

"If you're moving fast, it's important to at least know where you're going and why. This means - what's our vision, what's our strategy, and what are the metrics we are trying to move?

When we have lots of potential initiatives you evaluate if this fits with the mission if this is a part of your current strategy and how much of the problem it solves. Then, there's an evaluation of if we're the right company to solve this problem, what the effort is and then compare against each other.

This can't be just something you do when the pressure is on, it's an ongoing part of the product process to avoid having (too many) last-minute decisions."

## Openmindedness

"My adaptability is deeply rooted in my diverse experiences. I grew up in the UK, attended public schools in both the south and the midwest. My academic journey took me from technical colleges to studying political science. Along the way, I had roommates from different corners of the world, which further broadened my horizons.

Professionally, I've worked everywhere from farms to international corporations. I've been exposed to the structured approach of French institutions and the fast-paced nature of US firms. Each of these experiences exposed me to varying cultures, and I've always been eager to immerse myself fully.

This adaptability extends to languages too; I'm multilingual. My culinary experiments range from Indian and French to Chinese and South American recipes. There have been instances when communication was a challenge, either because I didn't understand or wasn't understood. However, these instances only fueled my eagerness to learn. I'm motivated, patient, and unafraid of making mistakes, always viewing them as opportunities to learn."

## Data in Decision Making

"I am data-driven and user-centric. Whether it's qualitative data from customer interactions or quantitative metrics, I use them to guide my decisions. I also believe in iterative testing to validate our strategies and to understand not just if they worked, but why. This allows us to continually iterate and improve."

## Cross-Team Transparency

"I make it a point to keep everyone in the loop, regardless of their function. I am proactive about communicating early and often to prevent conflicts and find synergies across projects. I value feedback and always leave room for it in discussions, ensuring that the strategies and metrics are collectively agreed upon."

## Communication and Leadership

"I'm a strong communicator with executive presence, capable of handling C-suite level discussions. My leadership style is adaptive; I tailor my approach to fit the needs of individual team members. I aim to set people up for success, allowing them to shine, share, and lead initiatives. I actively look for opportunities for my team members to gain visibility."

## Weakness

"One area I've had to work on is stress management. My fear of failure, especially in high-pressure situations, has sometimes led to overwork and stress eating. However, I've employed techniques like "going to the balcony" (Patrick Lancioni - Ideal Team Player) to step back and clear my mind. This has not only helped me make better decisions but also led to significant personal growth, including a weight loss of 70 pounds, which further contributes to my effectiveness and happiness at work."

## Back to an IC Role

"My experience in management has endowed me with a strong strategic vision and technical understanding that I can bring into an IC role. Being a leader has also honed my skills in cross-functional collaboration, which will help me work effectively within any team. 

I am consistently looking to grow and am passionate about building from the ground up, which suits both managerial and IC roles. My summer project has also been a one-man-band where I'm talking to customers, designing the experience, and coding it. I've tried to proactively reach out to mentors to get better at each of those."

## Strength

"One of my greatest strengths is my ability to create order out of chaos. I excel at cross-craft collaboration, making sure all team members, regardless of their function, have equal voices and influence. My technical knowledge allows for productive relationships with engineering, and I'm customer-focused. I always align solutions with user needs as the North Star.  

An example is the past three roles I've had. I spent the beginning of my career learning best practices in the three Ps (people, product, and process) and the past three implementing them at companies struggling. I come in with a mess, determine how to clean up, how to get ahead, and then hire around that vision."

## Working Style

"I'm highly collaborative and believe in collective accountability. Whether it's a small decision or a large project, I approach it thoughtfully and align it with the broader vision. I zoom in and out, shifting easily between strategy and execution. My aim is to bring everyone together, ensuring we're all marching to the same drumbeat. I'm not afraid to roll up my sleeves and get things done; I'm as comfortable strategizing as I am executing."

## My Management Style

"I think that I am good at understanding the audience and what they care about. Then, tailoring the story to the audience instead of just "everything I want to say." I also leave time for their feedback around our strategy, success metrics, and initiatives.

I also am extremely detail-oriented and check/double-check my work. I don't dismiss ideas but approach them pragmatically. I want to find the right things to prioritize, why, the impact, and then how to evangelize internally.

I'm big on keeping people in the loop and communicating early. It's important to have cross-team transparency so we can catch conflicting projects or complementary ones.

I have a deep technical knowledge which really helps have productive relationships with engineering. I can anticipate technical problems and adjust our backlog to increase velocity. I also can work with the team to break down problems with engineering and propose changes to improve quality and get the MVP where it needs to be.

With design and other peers, I'm able to really get aligned on what we're trying to achieve. Getting alignment enables autonomy. Instead of prescribing the solution and treating them as an agency, it's a partnership. When you give them freedom, you increase creativity.

I'm hyper customer-focused and like to get as much feedback as I can: user data, chatting with customers, getting internal context and historical learnings, looking at support and reported issues, and paying attention to upcoming trends. Great at anticipating value and impact and then demonstrating if things worked or not. But not just if it worked, but WHY and how we iterate from that. Finally, when we release, following up to make sure the results we saw in a test materialized in production."
