# Behavioral Interview Questions - Macy's Examples

## Framework Used: Situation Action Result

### Leadership/Influence

- **Nugget**: Working with the finance team on making major changes to how we implemented fraud controls.
- **Situation**: Put in place an ML fraud detection system that was more accurate and took the risk "off our books." However, rules still existing were impacting the customer experience with frictions. Leadership was scared to remove these rules and increase chargebacks.
- **Task**: Someone needed to get leadership buy-in by setting up clear objectives.
- **Action**: I worked with the engineering team to break down all of the existing rules, the number of users that would be exposed to each rule, and the level of risk. Then I compared to how much would be covered by the new ML system. We agreed to run a series of tests to make sure we weren't risking the business.
- **Result**: We got the go-ahead to move forward and removed more than half of the rules. It led to a conversion increase equivalent to \$80+M in new realized revenue (less abandonment).



### Teamwork

- **Nugget**: Delivery and Fulfillment Overlap and Inconsistency.
- **Situation**: A horizontal team was adding new options across pages, prioritizing their own work over the strategy and aesthetics of the vertical.
- **Action**: Organized our page strategy, framework of how delivery and fulfillment were used at this stage, and a way to make a cleaner journey.
- **Result**: Delivery and fulfillment were implemented in a more logical selection sequence across pages, simplifying each "next step" and leading to more cost-effective methods (more pickup and grouped shipping).



### Successes

- **Nugget**: Cache performance was causing a host of site issues from availability to blocking experiences.
- **Situation**: Caches of availability were built over time and had different levels of consistency. We were not checking true availability until pressing checkout. This threw errors 14% of the time. Users that experienced these errors converted at half the rate.
- **Action**: I broke down the types of errored transactions and their associated conversion drop (substitutability index). With this data, we got buy-in from engineering to do a full overhaul to centralize our cache and make it scalable in the cloud for all solutions.
- **Result**: In checkout alone, this led to \$90M in incremental transactions by removing over 5 additional customer actions to recover from an error.

### Cross-functional Difficult Situation

- **Nugget**: Auto-application of loyalty rewards - finance, accounting, and marketing.
- **Situation**: Earning and redeeming loyalty was complicated for a customer due to some dark patterns built over time. Our rewards expire but some customers were not using them on purchases. Our cross-functional partners included this predicted non-use into their financial models and the overall benefits. However, we believed in a customer-centric world, customers should always get the best deal available. We came to a crossroads of automatically applying rewards that would force them to redo their models or to keep this difficult redemption process in place.
- **Action**: Our hypothesis was in two parts: by automatically applying rewards, our conversion rates would go up, and (2) that LTV would go up. We modeled out what the conversion and repeat usage would need to be to offset any short-run drop in revenue and spun up a test to give assurance to our partners that this was good for the business and the customer.
- **Result**: Not only did conversion go up to offset the cost, but item return rates and call center contacts went down substantially. It was hard to rate the longer-term impact, but we did see a significant increase in CSAT scores for our checkout experience post-launch that we believe are highly correlated to loyalty.



### Conflict with Engineering

- **Nugget**: Velocity and pushback from engineering reduced velocity and impact.
- **Situation**: There was lots of resistance and surprisingly high effort-sizing due to past challenges. It stemmed from being burned in the past for missed timelines or incomplete features.
- **Action**: We promised to have their back when there was a scenario, and we demonstrated this with one of our major features (Klarna) which faced delays due to partner issues. The team went above and beyond to get it done.
- **Result**: Motivation increased, leading to improved velocity and quality. The team became a poster child for iterating and gelling effectively.

### Disagreement with Cross-functional Leadership

- **Nugget**: Experience impact on registrations versus conversions and LTV.
- **Situation**: An experience we wanted to build could reduce registrations but had potential to increase conversions. Marketing believed they had the means to reengage users, but there was extreme resistance to risk.
- **Action**: While my initial intuition suggested a certain direction, I decided to delve deeper into the data. This required combing through every interaction across different systems and understanding the entire funnel. The analysis revealed skyrocketed conversion rates and high-LTV users that offset any initial markdowns. We proposed a progressive approach starting with adjustments at the point of "Add to Basket," refining the checkout experience, and rethinking the guest checkout process.
- **Result**: Site usage tripled, conversion rates improved by 40%, and supply metrics increased by high single digits.
