# Comprehensive Approach to Marketing and Advertising Technology

## Omni-Channel MAdTech and Personalization

### Objective
Build and implement an end-to-end, omni-channel personalization strategy using our loyalty and in-app personalization system across all marketing channels—advertising, performance media, social media, CRM, Identity and Access Management (IAM), and push notifications. We will increase Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) by delivering highly targeted, personalized experiences to customers, thereby increasing engagement, conversion rates, and customer lifetime value (CLV).

### Overview
Our customers’ journeys do not start and stop with the first-party (1P) app; it is an omni-experience spanning external marketing triggers, internal triggers, app/in-store ordering, delivery, post-ordering, consumption, and reflection on the overall experience. By integrating our personalization engine across all marketing channels, we will create a unified customer experience that is consistent, relevant, and prompt. This will improve user engagement while optimizing our marketing spend; every dollar is spent on reaching the right customer with the right message at the right time.

## Key Pillars of the Strategy

### Centralized Personalization Platform
The core of our strategy is a centralized personalization engine that aggregates customer data from all touchpoints—first-party app usage and behavior, digital/analog purchase history, social media interactions, and CRM data. This platform will use a mix of rules-based and machine learning algorithms to generate real-time, personalized content and experiences matched with offers based on individual customer personas and cohorts.

### Channels within Scope

#### Advertising & Performance Media
Tailored ads are served based on customer preferences and behaviors to maximize relevance. With our renewed focus on switchers, we may need to invest more heavily in observational campaigns.

#### Direct Mail / Coupons
We currently invest significantly in paid media for customers near physical locations. Paper coupons are used frequently and attribute tangible revenue to the business. By reconciling their behavior across media mix modeling (MMM), social, analog, and the web, we can offer more relevant coupons to drive conversion and decrease the depth of discount.

#### Social Media
Personalized content is pushed through social media platforms, including retargeting campaigns with a strong focus on non-converted users and observational campaigns to tap into the switchers market.

#### CRM
Personalized email campaigns are generated with products and offers driven by customer behavior (digital and analog) and purchases to drive click-through rates (CTR).

#### Identification
Personalizes login experiences, offering tailored dashboards and recommendations. This extends across channels, not just in the first-party app (e.g., in-store scans, license plates, advanced cookies). However, it balances itself with frictionless guest checkout for guests that value privacy.

#### Push Notifications
Triggered notifications deliver relevant products and messaging based on user behavior and preferences. The goal is to use the fewest notifications that drive the highest engagement tailored to a customer's communication preferences.

#### Support
Customer history and preferences help provide personalized support and offer non-monetary gestures (e.g., their favorite order).

## Data Feedback Loop
Ideally, each interaction across these channels is a signal ingested by the personalization engine, continuously learning and improving the platform’s accuracy in its response.

---

## System Components

### Data Collection & Aggregation
- **Behavioral Data:** Browsing and engagement patterns, purchase history, social media engagement, CRM interactions, third-party data, and explicit feedback loops (reviews, complaints, support, etc.).  
- **Demographic Data:** Age, location, and gender with an emphasis on evolving target audiences.  
- **Location Data:** Relevant data on a customer's location for messaging and alerts.  
- **Store & Menu Data:** Non-user attributes introduced into the personalization engine to improve recommendations.

### Personalization Engine
- **Rules-Based Models:** Generalized personalization for broader cohorts defined by macro customer engagement patterns, enabling rapid iteration.  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Predict preferences and recommend products for fine-tuned personalization, supported by a build-buy-modify evaluation.  
- **Content Management System (CMS):** Create and host dynamic content for different user segments.  
- **Offer Management System:** Promotions for analog, first-party, and third-party channels dynamically served based on customer data and external factors (e.g., time of day, location, events).

### Omni-Channel Integration Layer
- **API Gateway:** Connects the personalization engine to external channels.  
- **Audience Integrations:** Creates real-time audiences for inclusion and exclusion targeting.  
- **AdTech Integration:** Simplifies dynamic ad creation and delivery.  
- **Push Notification Service:** Delivers real-time personalized notifications.

## Analytics & Reporting

### Metrics Dashboard
Tracks performance metrics like ROAS, conversion rates, CTR, and CLV.

### A/B Testing Integration
Allows experimentation across various touchpoints, including digital menu boards, kiosks, and more.

### Attribution Model
Analyzes the impact and attribution of each channel’s engagement and conversion to understand the performance of every dollar spent.

## Testing & Integration Phases

### Phase 1a: First-Party App Proof of Concept (POC) - 2024
**Objective:** Confirm the personalization engine’s effectiveness in driving higher engagement and conversion rates within the app and web.

**Tasks:**
- Implement a basic version of the personalization engine within the app for customers with varying degrees of signals.
- Start with the homepage, followed by infusion throughout the funnel.
- Run A/B tests comparing personalized content versus non-personalized content.
- Create seamless ordering flows as personalization gains traction.
- Measure key metrics like check growth, conversion rate, total sales, and profitability.

**Expected Outcomes:** Proven impact to justify full integration into other channels.

### Phase 1b: Audience Inclusion & Exclusion Review (POC) - 2025H1
**Objective:** Confirm that basic audience targeting can be applied effectively to both performance and brand digital media.

**Tasks:**
- Conduct an inclusion/exclusion targeting review of all media.
- Identify low-hanging fruit opportunities and apply them with A/B tests to see relative changes in ROAS.

**Expected Outcome:** Less money is spent on non-converting impressions.

### Phase 2: Digital Media Integration - 2025
