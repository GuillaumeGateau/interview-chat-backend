# Mastering Your Craft - How I Conduct One-on-Ones

## Overview

Everyone has different professional experiences at different organizations, diverse backgrounds in schooling with different focuses, been brought up in different homes in different parts of the country, and observed the world around them through a different lens. See a trend there? Differences. Your pathway to your own goals as a product manager will always be different than “everyone else’s.” That’s why you are here – it’s because of your differences that make you such a valuable member of the team.

The preceding self-evaluation and proceeding weekly one-on-ones are not intended to change who you are; quite the contrary. Instead, this exercise is meant to help you apply your experience in the role of a product manager. It will help you internalize the perspective of others, effectively leverage, and grow the skillset of your colleagues and empower you with an empathetic, science-based toolset to solve tangible customer problems.

The coming year’s growth plan has strong foundations in Marty Cagan’s Three Pillars of Product (required reading: *Inspired*): **People, Process, and Product.** Mastering these pillars will take you beyond the walls of the organization, readying you to tackle any major product challenge at any company. However, while you can add immense value to a company through great problem solving, you can add exponentially more value by helping grow those around you. We will call this the **multiplier effect** - the reverberating value you create throughout the organization as you help those around you grow.

For us to be successful, it will take: a bidirectional, trust-based relationship, honest introspection, and a willingness to try new ways of working. We should trust each other to share openly and give feedback both ways. We must work to establish that trust before we can both grow (I will be growing here just as much as you!). Once trust is established, we must look in the mirror and evaluate our fundamentals in the three pillars and our broader organizational impact. With trust and self-introspection, all that is left is putting in the effort to progress.

My priority is your personal and professional growth, and you have my commitment to help you on your pathway to your own goals as a product manager. My second priority is my own ability to help you get there, so expect that I perpetually seek out your feedback. We will embark on this journey together.

## Our Approach

### Planning and Prioritizing

#### Establishing Trust

Trust is the most important ingredient in our mutual success, but also in everyone’s well-being. We will look at trust through several frames of reference:

- Clarity on roles and responsibilities
- Comfort in sharing feedback both ways
- Confidence in confidentiality
- Tempering through trial and error

**Clarity of roles** helps set expectations for your areas of ownership and accountability. My role will primarily be empowering you to be successful in your areas of ownership. It’s not to make decisions for you but to help you have confidence in decision-making and reflection on the outcome. Naturally, I’m also here to support you in overcoming obstacles at the tactical level, but that will not be the concentration of our one-on-ones.

**Sharing feedback and confidentiality** go together. Our conversations are private and should be time where we can let our guard down and dig into the details without fear of judgment. With that foundation, we can have more honest and effective feedback. That feedback goes both ways. I – and your people leaders – am always growing in my role as much as you are growing in yours.

**Progress doesn’t happen overnight.** Arnold Schwarzenegger (yes, I’m stealing his speech) recently touched on the growth of civilization. He compared it to Conan’s Sword and the process to build it. Tempering steel is the process of heating it to a glow in a fire, hammering the heck out of it, then immediately submerging it into cold water. It changes the properties of the alloy from hard to strength and ductility. We will both improve through trial and error, but that will build our core strengths and our malleability for whatever problem comes our way.

### Self-Assessment

The self-assessment is for you more than it is for me. In fact, you are not required to share the assessment with me. The goal will be to review the skills that demonstrate your proficiency in the three pillars. For each of those skills, I’ve added a list of leading questions to help frame your thinking. Feel free to add more to the list. I recommend thinking critically about each question, your depth of knowledge or experience, and specific examples of that experience.

As you do your assessment, I recommend taking personal notes so that you can revisit and update over time. To summarize your notes, you might consider categorizing your perceived competency - novice, competent, experienced, or mastery. Remember, these are details you are **NOT** required to share with me.

### Looking Ahead

#### Strengths and Opportunities

After your self-assessment, we will need to set the context for our one-on-ones for the next year. It’s a long list, and we won’t be able to cover everything in a way that is meaningful. Pulling from the book *StrengthFinder*, it’s important to continue to build upon your strengths while honing the skills that make you a great, holistic product manager. While you should certainly keep everything top of mind, we will be focusing on four to six areas:

- Two/three of your strengths you want to harden
- Two/three opportunities for improvement you want to sharpen

You may claim *StrengthFinder* as an expense if you add it to our team library.

#### Measuring Success

Your personal growth will not be measured on a spreadsheet. Each one-on-one, we will be making progress together and will discuss overall growth. Every three months, you will reassess how you feel about each of your four/six investment areas. If you feel you’ve gotten to a point that meets (or exceeds) your expectations for yourself, we can pivot to another focus area. If not, we will continue until you do. Just like our OKRs, focus is key, and quality/outcomes are more important than quantity/output. Along this journey, I will share my own feedback and perspective.

## The Three Pillars

### Product Knowledge

#### User and Customer Knowledge
- Would you say that you have a deep understanding of our customer and their perception of the experience/offering?
- Are you able to evaluate how well we are meeting our customer needs and where we fall short? How do you identify the deal breakers that would drive a customer away?

#### Data Knowledge
- When looking to research/solve a problem, are you easily able to define the data you need?
- Do you feel confident hunting down key data and dealing with potential ambiguity?
- Do you believe that you can effectively translate data for storytelling?
- Can you identify the levers you can pull within the experience and how they impact customer behavior?

#### Industry/Domain Knowledge
- Can you reverse engineer industry trends or competitor feature sets to understand the customer problems others are trying to solve?
- Can you drill into why they made the product choices they made and identify other approaches that may be more efficacious?

#### Business and Company Knowledge
- Are you adept at framing your storytelling to your audience, taking into account the metrics that they measure their success on? (Customer, ops, marketing, sales, finance, loyalty, design, engineering, etc.)
- Do you believe in our company vision and understand how your work contributes to it?
- When conducting competitive analysis, are you able to anticipate how customer problems and solutions may be different based on our competitive positioning?

#### Product Operational Knowledge
- Do you have a deep understanding of how your product works and the purpose of each aspect of the experience?
- Many of you may be inheriting a product – how do you determine if the existing experience is really achieving its initial intentions? In areas we are falling short, can you differentiate what is worth prioritizing and where we must make tough calls?
- Do you understand the technical infrastructure? Can you anticipate technical challenges and speak to constraints?

### Process Skills and Techniques

#### Product Discovery Techniques
- Are you able to anticipate and mitigate risks within an initiative?
- Do you find other members of the POD are fully bought into the team’s objective and their strengths are being fully leveraged?
- Would you say your meetings are focused on clear customer problems with tangible progress made through the meeting?
- Do you feel like you can find and balance decisions across qualitative and quantitative observations?
- Whether it’s the full experience or a specific feature, do you have a method to determine the long-term value creation?

#### Product Optimization Techniques
- Do you have different approaches to research and testing net-new experiences vs major updates vs optimization?
- How do you decide when to AB test, do no harm test, or just roll out? When reviewing data from an AB test, are you able to translate that into a story on customer behavior change?
- Do you frequently research and try new product techniques, or do you lean on your current experience?

#### Product Delivery and Development Techniques
- Do you feel comfortable determining which product development frameworks (waterfall, agile/scrum, Kanban, scrum-ban, something new?) work best for any situation?
- If you were to ask your relevant product peers or cross-functional stakeholders, would they say there is clear direction and preparation?
- After an AB test, do you feel confident deciding to continue investment, pivot your approach, or move on to another focus area?
- North Star: If you go to an engineer and ask, “What are you working on, how does this help the customer, and what OKR does this move?” do you feel confident their answer would be aligned with the team’s objectives?

### People Skills and Responsibilities

#### Team Collaboration Skills
- Do you feel you effectively leverage the broader team at ideation and solving the customer problem?
- Does the team feel confident in what they’re building, the customer problem it solves, and how that maps to your team’s strategy?

#### Stakeholder Collaboration Skills
- Are you confident in framing your customer focus in a way that speaks to each of your main stakeholders?
- Would you say your stakeholders feel like trusted partners in solving customer problems?

#### Evangelism Skills

- Do your team and stakeholders believe in and are they committed to your roadmap? Would you say that they’re intrinsically motivated and passionate about the roadmap?

#### Leadership Skills
- How would you rate your ability to influence and inspire folks in digital and cross-functional stakeholders?
